# JLLWrappers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JuliaPackaging/JLLWrappers.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JuliaPackaging/JLLWrappers.jl)

This package contains an array of macros that enable JLL packages to generate themselves.  It is not intended to be used by users, but rather is used in autogenerated packages via [`BinaryBuilder.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl).
